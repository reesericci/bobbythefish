# bobbythefish

`bobbythefish` is the brother of the powerline-style shell [bobthefish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/theme-bobthefish)

### Installation

Clone the repository & cd into the parent directory

Be sure to have Oh My Fish installed. Then just:

    omf install bobbythefish

You will need a [Powerline-patched font][patching] for this to work, unless you enable the compatibility fallback option:

    set -g theme_powerline_fonts no

[I recommend picking one of these][fonts]. For more advanced awesome, install a [nerd fonts patched font][nerd-fonts], and enable nerd fonts support:

    set -g theme_nerd_fonts yes

This theme is based [bobthefish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/theme-bobthefish).
